# Typing Speed Website (CS50x Final Project)

Main skills learnt/practiced:

- How WPM is actually calculated
- CSS custom variables
- Colour themes using these variables in a :root class selector
- Using SVGs and altering them in HTML
- Animated collapsible elements
- ES6 modules
- Shuffling arrays via the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (and benefits over other, perhaps simpler shuffling algorithms, mainly performance as well as less permutation biases)
- Properties of e e.g. .inputType
- Difference in performance when creating and appending vast numbers of child elements via createElement()/appendChild vs template literals added to .innerHTML
- Settings timeouts and intervals, as well as clearing them
